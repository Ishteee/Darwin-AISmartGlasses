# Darwin - AI Smart Glasses

**Darwin** is a pair of AI-powered smart glasses designed and built with a 3D-printed frame and a Raspberry Pi at its core. The device integrates powerful AI features, including voice and vision capabilities using Gemini, and connects to a companion mobile app for managing captured media.

## Overview

Darwin is a wearable AI device that combines computer vision, voice interaction, and edge computing in a compact form factor. It allows users to interact with the world using simple voice commands or by capturing images and videos with an integrated camera. The system supports real-time voice-based Q&A, image-based queries, and remote media access via a mobile application.
